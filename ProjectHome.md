**This application is born to help you save time organizing the subtitles for the TV Shows you usually follow.**

The application lets you download the chosen subtitles from subtitulos.es, renaming them as you download them, and lets you rename the srt files in a videos folder, matching the episodes name.

Renaming the srt files is usually an issue when getting subtitles from ~~subtitulos.es~~ subswiki.com (http://www.subswiki.com) and you are following USA TV Shows, so you can make it quick and easier, as well as you can quickly grab the srt file from the application.

In few words: Subs Organizer wants to make your like as a TVShows watcher easier!
